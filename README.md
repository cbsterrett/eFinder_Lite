# eFinder Lite

## Important
This variant is currently under development - may contain bugs!

The autostart version eFinder_Lite.py is version eFinder_Lite_2_6 which uses Cedar-Detect for detection and Cedar-Solve for solving.

If you want to use Tetra3, rename eFinder_Lite1_7.py to eFinder_Lite.py
